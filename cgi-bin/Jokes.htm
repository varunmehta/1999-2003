A husband and wife were sound asleep at 2AM
when the phone rang.
The husband picked up the phone and sleepily said,
"Hello.......How the hell should I know.....what am I,
the Weather Bureau???" He slammed the phone
down and tried to get comfortable again.
"Who was that?" asked his wife.
"I don't know...some jerk wanted to know if the
coast was clear."</LI></OL>

<P>An attractive young woman goes up to the bar in a quiet rural pub somewhere
in Maine. She gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately.
When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face
close to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his bushy beard.
"Are you the manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands."
"Actually, no" he replies.
"Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?" she asks, running her
hands up beyond his beard and into his hair.
"I'm afraid I can't" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there anything I can do?"
"Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues huskily,
popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.
"Tell him" she says "that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the
ladies room."</P>

"Show how it is possible to determine the height of the building using a barometer." </B></U></P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=2>




 

<P>The student had answered, "Take the barometer to the top of the building,
 attach a long rope to it,lower it to the street,and then bring it up, 
measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building."</P>

<P>The student really had a strong case for full credit since he had really 
answered the question completely and correctly! On the other hand,if full 
credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade in his physics 
course and to certify competence in physics, but the answer did not confirm this.</P>

<P>I suggested that the student have another try. I gave the student six minutes 
to answer the question with the warning that the answer should show some knowledge 
of physics. At the end of five minutes,he had to written anything. I asked if he 
wished to give up, but he said he had many answers to this problem; he was just 
thinking of the best one. I excused myself for interrupting him and asked him to please go on.</P>

<P>In the next minute, he dashed off his answer which read:
"Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of 
the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a stopwatch. Then,using 
the formula x=0.5*a*t^^2, calculate the height of the building.
"At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded,
and gave the student almost full credit.</P>

<P>While leaving my colleague's office, I recalled that the student had said 
that he had other answers to the problem,so I asked him what they were.
"Well," said the student, "there are many ways of getting the height of 
a tall building with the aid of a barometer.For example,you could take 
the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer, 
the length of its shadow,and the length of the shadow of the building, 
and by the use of simple proportion,determine the height of the building."</P>
<P>"Fine," I said, "and others?"</P>
<P>"Yes," said the student, "there is a very basic measurement method you will like.
In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up the stairs.
As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the barometer along the wall. 
You then count the number of marks, and his will give you the height of
the building in barometer units."
"A very direct method."</P>

<P>"Of course. If you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the barometer 
to the end of a string,swing it as a pendulum, and determine the value of g at 
the street level and at the top of the building.From the difference between the 
two values of g, the height of the building,in principle, can be calculated."
"On this same tact, you could take the barometer to the top of the building,
attach a long rope to it, lower it to just above the street,and then swing 
it as a pendulum.You could then calculate the height of the building by the 
period of the precession".</P>

<P>"Finally," he concluded, "there are many other ways of solving the problem.
Probably the best,"he said, "is to take the barometer to the basement and 
knock on the superintendent's door.When the superintendent answers,
you speak to him as follows: 'Mr.Superintendent, here is a fine barometer. If you will
tell me the height of the building, I will give you this barometer."
At this point, I asked the student if he really did not know the conventional 
answer to this question. He admitted that he did, but said that he was fed 
up with high school and college instructors trying to teach him how to think.
The student was Neils Bohr and the arbiter Rutherford.</P>

Facilities </B></U></P>

<p>THERE was a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and
elegant, especially in language. She and her husband were planning a
week'svacation in Florida, so she wrote to a campground and asked for a
reservation.She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped, but didn't
know how to ask about the toilet facilities. She just could not bring herself
to write the word "toilet" in her letter.After much deliberation, she
finally came up  with the term "bathroom commode". But after writing
that down,she still  thought she was being too forward, so she rewrote
the entire letter and  referred to the "bathroom commode" merely as the
"BC". "Does the campground have its own BC?" is what she actually wrote.</P>

<P>Well, the camp ground owner wasn't old-fashioned at all and when he got
the letter, he just couldn't figure what the woman was talking about.
That"BC" business really stumped him. He showed the letter to several
couples, but they couldn't imagine what the lady meant either. So the camp ground
owner finally came to the conclusion that the lady must be asking about the
location of the nearest Baptist Church, sat down and wrote the following</P>
<P>
DEAR MADAM, </P> <P>  I regret the delay in answering your letter, but I now
take the pleasure of  informing you that a BC is located 9 milesnorth of
the campground and is  capable of seating 250 people at one time. It is
located in a beautiful pine  grove and is open only on Sundays and
Wednesdays. I admit it is quite a  distance away if you are in the habit
of going regularly, but no doubt you will  be pleased to know that many
people take their lunch along and make a day  of it. They usually arrive
early and stay late.   My daughter met her husband in the BC. Sometimes
it is so
crowded there  are five to a seat. It may interest you to know that
right now there is a  supper  planned to raise money to buy more seats.
They are going to hold it in the  basement of the BC. It pains me very
much not to be able to go more  regularly, but it is surely not due to a
lack of desire on my part. As we  grow  older, it seems to be more of an
effort, particularly in cold weather. If  you  decide to come to our
campground, perhaps I could go with you the first time  you go and sit
with you and introduce you to all the other folks. We will  be  sure to
get a seat up front where you can be seen by everyone. Remember,  we are
a friendly community.</P>

<P>Sincerely,
the Campground Owner.</P>
