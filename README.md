# 1999-2003
This is an archive of all my web development antics and experiments with digital art from 1999-2003. Time when I was more into HTML and was learning the ropes of ASP and Java. Even though I had have lost most of the source code, I was able to get the final files. 

It was an interesting journey trying to retrive the information from my old tripod.com account. I was able to get a lot of my old stuff back! Some of the digital art images seems to have been corrupted, with no way to retrive them.

Enjoy the archives....

## Projects 

Somewhere around 2000-2001 if you searched "varun mehta" or "varun info" I would be the top 3 results on google 

### Acres 
[Acres club](https://theacresclub.com/) opened in 2000 in Chembur. Was one of the first lifestyle clubs after a long time. I did their first website ever. 

### Digital Art
Was a big fan of CGI (computer generated imagery) back in school, and was planning to pursue [MDes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Design), and also apply for Pratt. These were an effort to build a portfolio. A lot of the art you see here was built on either photoshop or blender or 3d Studio Max

### Flash 
All the side-gigs and projects I did as a freelancer making money to buy my first motorcycle

### MME 
My dad's side-gig along with his job

### Varuninfo
This was my first personal website, where I highlighted my portfolio and uploaded a crude resume. Went thru multiple iterations. You can see them under as ver1 to ver7 

### VarunMehta
Along the way somewhere I started building another portfolio with my complete name. 


## TODO
* [x] Provide some details about all the folders 
* [ ] Make sites accessible again so they can relive their glory days from the early 2000s 
* [ ] Migrate all the [Flash stuff to Ruffle](https://www.purplesquirrels.com.au/2023/12/bringing-life-back-to-old-flash-content/)
