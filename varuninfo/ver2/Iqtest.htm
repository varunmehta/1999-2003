      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">This test does not measure intelligence, 
        your fluency with words, creativity or mathematical ability. It will,however, 
        give you some gauge of your mental flexibility.In the three years since 
        the test was developed, few people have been found who could solve more 
        than half of the 26 questions on the first try. Many, however, reported 
        getting answers long after the testing had been set aside, particularly 
        at unexpected moments when their minds were relaxed. Some reported solving 
        all the questions over a period of several days. Take the test as your 
        personal challenge. 16 correct answers out of the 26 = Genius. Instructions: 
        Each equation below contains the initials of words that will make it correct. 
        Furnish the missing words. For example: 60 = M in an H. would be 60 = 
        Minutes in an Hour.</span></p>

        FOR PARENTHOOD OR NOT !?</b></span></h5>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">MESS TEST: Smear peanut butter on the 
        sofa and curtains. Now rub your hands in the wet flower bed and rub on 
        the walls. Cover the stains with crayons. Place a fish stick behind the 
        couch and leave it there all summer. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">TOY TEST: Obtain a 55-gallon box of 
        Legos. (If Legos are not available, you may substitute roofing tacks or 
        broken bottles.) Have a friend spread them all over the house. Put on 
        a blindfold.Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen. Do not scream (this 
        could wake a child at night). </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">GROCERY STORE TEST: Borrow one or two 
        small animals (goats are best) and take them with you as you shop at the 
        grocery store. Always keep them in sight and pay for anything they eat 
        or damage. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">DRESSING TEST: Obtain one large, unhappy, 
        live octopus. Stuff into a small net bag making sure that all arms stay 
        inside. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">FEEDING TEST: Obtain a large plastic 
        milk jug. Fill halfway with water. Suspend from the ceiling with a stout 
        cord. Start the jug swinging. Try to insert spoonfuls of soggy cereal 
        (such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios) into the mouth of the jug while pretending 
        to be an airplane. Now dump the contents of the jug on the floor. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">NIGHT TEST: Prepare by obtaining a 
        small cloth bag and fill it with 8 to 12 pounds of sand. Soak it thoroughly 
        in water. At 8:00 PM begin to waltz and hum with the bag until 9:00 PM. 
        Lay down your bag and set your alarm for 10:00 PM. Get up, pick up your 
        bag, and sing every song you have ever heard. Make up about a dozen more 
        and sing these too until 4:00 AM. Set alarm for 5:00 AM. Get up and make 
        breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">PHYSICAL TEST (WOMEN): Obtain a large 
        bean-bag chair and attach it to the front of your clothes. Leave it there 
        for 9 months. Now remove 10% of the beans. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">PHYSICAL TEST (MEN): Go to the nearest 
        drug store. Set your wallet on the counter. Ask the clerk to help himself. 
        Now proceed to the nearest food store. Go to the head office and arrange 
        for your paycheck to be directly deposited to the store. Purchase a newspaper. 
        Go home and read it quietly for the last time. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">FINAL ASSIGNMENT: Find a couple who 
        already have a small child. Lecture them on how they can improve their 
        discipline, patience, tolerance, toilet training, and child's table manners. 
        Suggest many ways they can improve. Emphasize to them that they should 
        never allow their children to run riot. Enjoy this experience. It will 
        be the last time you will have all the answers. </span></p>

      <h5 align="left"><span class="Arial9"><b>SHOW HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE 
        THE HEIGHT OF A BUILDING USING A BAROMETER</b></span></h5>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">The student had answered, "Take the 
        barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it,lower it 
        to the street,and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. 
        The length of the rope is the height of the building."</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">The student really had a strong case 
        for full credit since he had really answered the question completely and 
        correctly! On the other hand,if full credit were given, it could well 
        contribute to a high grade in his physics course and to certify competence 
        in physics, but the answer did not confirm this.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">I suggested that the student have another 
        try. I gave the student six minutes to answer the question with the warning 
        that the answer should show some knowledge of physics. At the end of five 
        minutes,he had to written anything. I asked if he wished to give up, but 
        he said he had many answers to this problem; he was just thinking of the 
        best one. I excused myself for interrupting him and asked him to please 
        go on.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">In the next minute, he dashed off his 
        answer which read: "Take the barometer to the top of the building and 
        lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with 
        a stopwatch. Then,using the formula x=0.5*a*t^^2, calculate the height 
        of the building. "At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give 
        up. He conceded, and gave the student almost full credit.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">While leaving my colleague's office, 
        I recalled that the student had said that he had other answers to the 
        problem,so I asked him what they were. "Well," said the student, "there 
        are many ways of getting the height of a tall building with the aid of 
        a barometer.For example,you could take the barometer out on a sunny day 
        and measure the height of the barometer, the length of its shadow,and 
        the length of the shadow of the building, and by the use of simple proportion,determine 
        the height of the building."</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">"Fine," I said, "and others?"</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">"Yes," said the student, "there is 
        a very basic measurement method you will like. In this method, you take 
        the barometer and begin to walk up the stairs. As you climb the stairs, 
        you mark off the length of the barometer along the wall. You then count 
        the number of marks, and his will give you the height of the building 
        in barometer units." "A very direct method."</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">"Of course. If you want a more sophisticated 
        method, you can tie the barometer to the end of a string,swing it as a 
        pendulum, and determine the value of g at the street level and at the 
        top of the building.From the difference between the two values of g, the 
        height of the building,in principle, can be calculated." "On this same 
        tact, you could take the barometer to the top of the building, attach 
        a long rope to it, lower it to just above the street,and then swing it 
        as a pendulum.You could then calculate the height of the building by the 
        period of the precession".</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="Arial9">"Finally," he concluded, "there are 
        many other ways of solving the problem. Probably the best,"he said, "is 
        to take the barometer to the basement and knock on the superintendent's 
        door.When the superintendent answers, you speak to him as follows: 'Mr.Superintendent, 
        here is a fine barometer. If you will tell me the height of the building, 
        I will give you this barometer." At this point, I asked the student if 
        he really did not know the conventional answer to this question. He admitted 
        that he did, but said that he was fed up with high school and college 
        instructors trying to teach him how to think. The student was Neils Bohr 
        and the arbiter Rutherford.</span></p>
