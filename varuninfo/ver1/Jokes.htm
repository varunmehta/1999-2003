        i touch it hurts." <br>
        The doc says"OK.touch ur elbow." <br>
        The sardarji touches his elbow and winces in genuine pain <br>
        . The doc,surprised,says "touch ur head." <br>
        The sardarji touches his head and jumps in agony. <br>
        The doc asks him to touch his knee and the same thing happens. <br>
        Every where the sardarji touches it hurts like hell. <br>
        The doc is stumped and orders a complete examination with <br>
        X-rays etc.. and tells the sardar to come back in 2 days. <br>
        Two days later the sardar comes back and the doctor says, "We've found

        "oh yeah?what is it?" <br>
        'you've broken ur finger!'. <br>

        Once Santa got a chance to travel by air. As the plane took off, <br>
        he felt like vomitting. He immediately rang for the air hostess and <br>
        told his problem. She gave him a paper-bag and told him to vomit in <br>
        it and went away. She came back after 2 minutes to find each and <br>
        every person in the plane vomitting badly except Santa. Surprised, <br>
        she asked Santa as to what the hell happenned. <br>
        Santa-"O jadon main ulti kitti, sare loki kain lagge chee-chee, te main

        -ANY DAUGHTERS:<br>
        <br>
        Part I ====== <br>
        Santa Singh was travelling in a crowded bus. He was carrying the Passport 
        <br>
        size photograph of his son (for college admission). Accidently,the photograph 
        <br>
        fell down from his pocket.He started searching for it frantically &amp; 
        found the <br>
        same on the floor of the bus. Politely,he asked the saree clad female,standing 
        <br>
        in front of him,"Can you lift that saree? I wanna take photograph" The 
        rest is <br>
        history. He was beaten so badly that he had to be admitted in a hospital. 
        <br>
        Part II ======= <br>
        He was surprised to see Banta Singh on the bed next to him,in a still 
        worse <br>
        condition. Banta started to explain his "Adventure". He had gone to a 
        remote <br>
        village on some work &amp; due to his high level of intelligence, couldn't 
        <br>
        finish the work on time. He had missed the last bus from that place. <br>
        He couldn't find any Hotel.So he approached a nearby house and asked <br>
        the Owner whether he can stay there for the night.The Owner replied <br>
        "I have 2 grown up daughters. Sorry,I can't allow you to stay". <br>
        He approached the next house and asked whether he can stay there <br>
        for the night.The Owner replied, "I have 3 grown up daughters. <br>
        Sorry,I can't allow you to stay". He went towards the next house <br>
        and without taking any risks,asked," Do you have "grown up" daughters?". 
        <br>
        The Owner asked,"WHY?????????" Banta replied," I wanted to stay here for 
        a night..... " <br>

        Nawaz Sherrif comes to Delhi for a meeting with Vajpayee. After <br>
        dinner,Vajpayee says to Nawaz Sherrif; "Well Nawaz, I don't know <br>
        what you think of the members of your Cabinet, but mine are all <br>
        bright and brilliant. " How do you know?" asks Nawaz Sherrif <br>
        "Oh well, it's simple", says Atal. " They all have to take special <br>
        tests before they can be a minister. Wait a second". He calls <br>
        Advani over and says to him. "Tell me Advaniji, who is the child of <br>
        your father and of your mother who is not your brother and is not <br>
        your sister?" "Ah, that's simple", says Advani, "it is me!" <br>
        "Well done Advani", says Vajpayee and Nawaz Sherrif is very <br>
        impressed. <br>
        <br>
        He returns to Islamabad and wonders about the intelligence of the <br>
        Members of his Cabinet. He calls in his favourite member of <br>
        cabinet and asks "Tell me, who is the child of your father and of <br>
        your mother who is not your brother and is not your sister? " <br>
        He thinks and thinks and doesn't know the answer. <br>
        "Can I think about it a bit further Nawaz ? May I let you know <br>
        tomorrow? <br>
        "Of course", says Nawaz Sherrif , "you've got 24 hours." <br>
        <br>
        He goes away, thinks as hard as he can, calls in his <br>
        CabinetSecretary, <br>
        Chief Secretaries and Joint Secretaries, but no-one knows the <br>
        answer. <br>
        Twenty hours later, the member of Nawaz's cabinet is very worried <br>
        still no answer and only 4 hours to go. Eventually he says "I'll <br>
        ask Benazer,she's clever, she'll know the answer." He calls <br>
        Benazir. "Benazir ", he says, "tell me who is the child of your <br>
        father and of your mother who is not your brother and is not your <br>
        sister?""Very simple", says Benazir, "it's me!" <br>
        "Of course" says the Cabinet member and rings Nawaz Sherrif. <br>
        "Nawaz", says he, "I've got the answer it's Benazer Bhutto". <br>

        for $10,000 dollars or an American's for $25,000 <br>
        dollars or I can give you 10 gms. of a Paki's brain for <br>
        $100,000 dollars." <br>
        The patient asked,"Why is the Paki's brain so much <br>
        more expensive than the others?" <br>
        "Well," replied the surgeon, "we have to go through <br>
        a lot of Pakistanis to find 10 gms of brain." <br>

        <br>
        Did you hear about the Pakistani who studied diligently for five days 
        ? <br>
        He was scheduled to take a urine test. <br>
        <br>
        Did you hear about the shutdown of the Karachi National Library ? <br>
        Somebody stole the book. <br>
        <br>
        -COPY CAT <br>
        <br>
        Three Indians and three Pakistanis are traveling by train to a <br>
        conference. At the station, the three Pakistanis each buy tickets and 
        <br>
        watch as the three Indians buy only a single ticket. How are three <br>
        people going to travel on only one ticket?" asks a Pakistani. Watch and 
        <br>
        you'll see," answers an Indian.They all board the train. The Pakistanis 
        <br>
        take their respective seats, but all three Indians cram into a restroom 
        <br>
        and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train has departed, 
        <br>
        the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the restroom 
        <br>
        door and says, "Ticket, please." The door opens just a crack and a <br>
        single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and <br>
        moves on. <br>
        <br>
        The Pakistanis see this and agree it is quite a clever idea. So after 
        <br>
        the conference, the Pakistanis decide to copy the Indians on the return 
        <br>
        trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all that). When 
        <br>
        they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. 
        <br>
        To their astonishment, the Indians don't buy a ticket at all. "How are 
        <br>
        you going to travel without a ticket?" asks one perplexed Pakistani. <br>
        Watch and you'll see," answers a Indian.When they board the train, the 
        <br>
        three Pakistanis cram into one restroom and the three Indians cram into 
        <br>
        another one nearby. The train departs. Shortly afterward, one of the <br>
        Indians leaves his restroom and walks over to the restroom where the <br>
        Pakistanis are hiding. He knocks on the door and says, "Ticket, please." 
        <br>
        <br>
        Moral of the story : Pakistanis cannot even copy Indians without goofing 
        <br>
        up. <br>
        <br>
        -TELEPHONE BILL<br>
        <br>
        In order to develop friendly relationship between the two countries, <br>
        I.K.Gujral and Nawaz Sharif decided to visit each other's country <br>
        regularly. <br>
        The first visit was by Gujral to Pakistan. There Sharif showed <br>
        him Pakistan's modern telecommunication systems. It was so good that <br>
        Gujral made a call to Rajiv Gandhi in hell and talked to him for 5 minutes! 
        <br>
        And the bill for the call came up to only Re.1. <br>
        When Gujral came back, he also wanted India's telecommunication systems 
        to be at <br>
        the best when Nawaz Sharif visited India. Suitable arrangements were made. 
        <br>
        Sharif came to India, visited the telecom department <br>
        and talked to Zia-ul-Haq in hell for 5 minutes. But this time, the bill 
        came up <br>
        to Rs. 500! <br>
        Sharif asked with a sarcastic smile - <br>
        "Why are telephone calls to hell so costly in India ?" <br>
        A High level diplomat gave a smiling reply - "From Pakistan to hell, it 
        is only <br>
        a local call, Sir, while from <br>
        India it is a long distance call!". <br>
        <br>
        -INDEPENDENCE DAY SPECIAL <br>
        <br>
        There's an Indian, a Pakistani and a beautiful woman sitting next to <br>
        each other on a train. The train goes through a tunnel and everything 
        <br>
        gets dark. Suddenly there is a kissing sound and then a slap! <br>
        The train comes out of the tunnel. The woman and the Indian are sitting 
        <br>
        there looking perplexed. <br>
        The Pakistani is bent over holding his face which is red from an <br>
        apparent slap. The Pakistani is thinking "Ya Allah, that Indian <br>
        must have tried to kiss this lady, she thought it was me and slapped <br>
        me." The lady is thinking, "That Pakistani must have moved to kiss me 
        and <br>
        kissed the Indian instead and got slapped." The Indian was thinking to 
        <br>
        himself..."If this train goes through another tunnel, I could <br>
        make another kissing sound and slap that Pakistani again." <br>

<p><span class="Arial9">-JEWISH SONS</span></p>
      <p><span class="Arial9"> A Jewish father was concerned about his son who 
        was about a year away from his <br>
        Bar Mitzvah but was sorely lacking in his knowledge of the Jewish faith.To 
        <br>
        remedy this he sent his son to Israel to experience his heritage.A year 
        later the <br>
        young man returned home. "Father,thank you for sending me to the <br>
        land of our Fathers," the son said."It was wonderful and enlightening,however,I 
        <br>
        must confess that while in Israel I converted to Christianity." <br>
        "Oy vey," replied the father,"what have I done." So in the tradition of 
        the patriarchs, <br>
        he went to his best friend and sought his advice and solace. <br>
        "It is amazing that you should come to me," stated his friend,"I too sent 
        my son to Israel <br>
        and he returned a Christian." So in the tradition of the patriarchs,they 
        <br>
        went to the Rabbi."It is amazing that you should come to me," stated the 
        Rabbi,"I too <br>
        sent my son to Israel and he returned a Christian.What is happening to 
        our sons?" <br>
        Brothers,we must take this to the Lord," said the Rabbi. <br>
        They fell to their knees and began to wail and pour out their hearts to 
        the Almighty. <br>
        As they prayed the clouds above opened and a Mighty Voice stated, <br>
        "Amazing that you should come to Me. I,too, sent My Son to Israel....."

        A man traveling by train asks the ticket collector what time <br>
        the train stops at Victoria. <br>
        "Sir, we don't stop at Victoria." <br>
        "But I have to get off there!" <br>
        "Well, there might be one thing I can do. I might be able to <br>
        get the engineer to slow down the train a little. Then I can <br>
        dangle you out the door and lower you onto the platform." <br>
        "Will that work?" <br>
        "It's worth a try." <br>
        As they approached the platform, the train is slowing from <br>
        50 MPH. The collector hangs the man in mid-air out the <br>
        door. The man starts running in mid-air. "Run faster! <br>
        Faster!" He lowers the man and the man's feet touch the <br>
        platform. His shoes start to smoke! His heel comes off! <br>
        He's running at 30 MPH. He's made it! He starts to slow <br>
        down! The other passengers stare in amazement. <br>
        As the last car goes by, a hand grabs the man by the shirt <br>
        collar and lifts the man right back into the train! As he's <br>
        helped back on the train the gent who picked him up says, <br>
        "Man you're lucky I was here to help! This train doesn't even <br>

        The next question, intended for people, who had answered in the <br>
        affirmative to <br>

        An attractive young woman goes up to the bar in a quiet rural pub somewhere 
        <br>
        in Maine. She gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately. 
        <br>
        When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face 
        <br>
        close to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his bushy 
        beard. <br>
        "Are you the manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands." 
        <br>
        "Actually, no" he replies. <br>
        "Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?" she asks, running her 
        <br>
        hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. <br>
        "I'm afraid I can't" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there 
        anything I can do?" <br>
        "Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues huskily, 
        <br>
        popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them 
        gently. <br>
        "Tell him" she says "that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the 
        <br>
        ladies room." <br>

        "I'm calling to report my neighbor Tom. He is hiding <br>
        marijuana in his firewood." <br>
        "This will be noted." <br>
        Next day, the FBI comes over to Tom's house. They <br>
        search the shed where the firewood is kept, break <br>
        every piece of wood, find no marijuana, swear at Tom <br>
        and leave. <br>
        The phone rings at Tom's house. <br>
        "Hey, Tom! Did the FBI come?" <br>
        "Yeah!" <br>
        "Did they chop your firewood?" <br>
        "Yeah they did." <br>
        "Okay, now it's your turn to call. I need my <br>
        garden plowed." <br>

        -TRAIN SEATS <br>
        <br>
        An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several 
        weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been 
        granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very 
        crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an 
        empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed 
        middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier 
        asked, "Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?" The English woman looked 
        down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, "You Americans. You are 
        such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little Fifi is using that 
        seat?" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but 
        after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing 
        the woman with the dog. Again he asked, "Please, lady. May I sit there? 
        I'm very tired." The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "You 
        Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!" The 
        soldier didn't say anything else. He leaned over, picked up the little 
        dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. 
        The woman shrieked and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the 
        soldier. An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, "You 
        know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong 
        thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos 
        on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch 
        out of the window." <br>

        <br>
        </span><span class="Arial9">A little old lady goes to the doctor and says, 
        <br>
        "Doctor I have this problem with gas, but it really <br>
        doesn't bother me too much. They never smell and are always silent. <br>
        In fact I've farted at least 20 times since I've been here <br>
        in your office. You didn't know I was farting because <br>
        they didn't smell and were silent." The doctor says, <br>
        "I see. Take these pills and come back to see me next week." <br>
        The next week the lady goes back, "Doctor," she says, <br>
        "I don't know what the heck you gave me, but now my farts <br>
        ...although still silent, stink terribly." "Good," <br>
        the doctor said, "now that we've cleared up your sinuses, <br>
        let's work on your hearing." <br>
        <br>

        A young businessman had just started his own firm. He'd rented beautiful 
        office <br>
        and had it furnished with antiques. Sitting there, he saw a man come into 
        the outer <br>
        office. Wishing to appear the hot shot, the businessman picked <br>
        up the phone and started to pretend he had big deal working. He threw 
        huge <br>
        figures around and ade giant commitments. Finally he hung up and asked 
        the visitor, <br>
        "Can I help you?" The man said, "Yeah, I've come to activate your phone 
        lines." <br>

        says, <br>
        "There are three rooms here from which you may pick one to spend eternity 
        in." <br>
        So the guy looks in the first room, and it is filled with people standing 
        on <br>
        thier heads on a concrete floor. The second room has everyone standing 
        on thier <br>
        heads on a wooden floor. In the third room he finds a peculiar sight ... 
        <br>
        everyone is up to thier neck in crap, but thier all drinking coffee. He 
        looks at the <br>
        devil and says "I'll take this one." After ten minutes of drinking coffee 
        in the <br>
        third room, the P.A. system blurts out "Alright you guys, coffee break's 
        over <br>
