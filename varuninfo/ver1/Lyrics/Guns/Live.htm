*Reckless Life (3:20)

I'm reckless and feelin' no pain
You know I've got no need to control
Livin' with the danger
I'm always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
And you know I know my part

On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time

Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
'Cause it's comin' from my heart

I lead a reckless life
And I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only vice

Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...

Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...



<a name=NiceBoys></a>
*Nice Boys (3:02)

She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
Ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!

Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get her ass around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!


<a name=Move></a>
*Move to the City (3:42)

You pack your bags
And you move to the city
There's somethin' missin' here at home
You fix your hair
And you look real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You're always fightin'
With your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, You gotta move
You gotta move

You stole your mama's car
And your daddy's plastic credit card
You're sixteen and you can't get a job
You're not goin' very far
You're always fightin'
With the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, You gotta move
You gotta move
Right to the city
Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!

You're on the streets
And it ain't so pretty
At least you get to do what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees!

Always fightin'
With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
To the city where it all began

You gotta move, You gotta move
Time you gotta move
In the city
With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!



<a name=MamaKin></a>
*Mama Kin (3:54)

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya, honey, how it feels
I've been dreamin' floatin' down stream
And losin' touch with all that's real
Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you been
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with mama kin!

You always got your tail on the wag
Spittin' fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

It ain't easy livin' like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth
With his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no

It ain't easy livin' like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth
With his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me


<a name=Patience></a>
*Patience (5:53)

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now

Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow
And we come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait here
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know love
There's one more thing to consider

Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining so bright
You and I've got what it takes
To make it, We won't fake it,
I'll never break it
'cause I can't take it

need a little patience
just a little patience
some more patience
need some patience
could use some patience
gotta have some patience
all it takes is patience
just a little patience
is all you need 

I've been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right
Its hard to see with so many around
No I don't like being stuck in the ground

And the streets don't change but baby the names
I ain't got time for this game 'cause I need you

Yeah yeah yeah Oh I need you
I need you
I need you
This time



<a name=UsedTo></a>
*Used to Love Her (3:10)

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I knew I'd miss her
So I had to keep her
She's buried right in my backyard

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
She bitched so much, She drove me nuts
And now I'm happier this way

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I had to put her, six feet under
And I can still hear her complain


<a name=Crazy></a>
*You're Crazy (4:08)

I've been lookin' for a trace
Lookin' for a heart,
Lookin' for a lover in a world
That's much too dark
Because you don't want my love
You want satisfaction

You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another
Another piece, another piece of the Action,

Say where ya goin? What you gonna do?
I been lookin' everywhere said I,
I been lookin' for you
Because you don't want my love
You want satisfaction
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another
Another piece, another piece
Of the action

You're crazy, 
You know you're crazy, oh my!
You're fuckin' crazy, oh child
You know you're crazy
Hey Heyyyyy.....


Say, boy, where ya comin' from?
Where'd ya get that point of view?
When I was young yeah,
I knew a motherfucker like you,
and she said,
You don't need my love,
You wanna sati-satisfaction,
You don't need my love,
You've got to find yourself another
Another piece, another piece
Of the action

You're crazy
You know you're crazy, oh my!
You're fuckin' crazy, oh child
You know you're crazy
You know you're crazy
You're fuckin' crazy, Oh child
You know you're crazy
You're fuckin' crazy
You know you are
Bring it down
You're fuckin' crazy


<a name=Million></a>
*One in a Million (6:08)

Guess I needed sometime to get away
I needed some piece of mind
Some piece of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to Sixth and L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way

Police and Niggers, that's right
Get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your
Gold chains today
I don't need no bracelets
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket 'til then
Won't you cut me some slack?

You're one in a million
Yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, much too high,
Much too high

Immigrants and faggots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran,
Or spread some fuckin' disease
They talk so many goddamn ways
It's all greek to me

Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be

But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to an end, I
I keep it movin' along

You're one in a million
You're a shooting star
You're one in a million, babe
You know that you are
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, much too high
Yeah,
Much too high,

Radicals and Racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Just tryin' to make ends meet
I don't need your religion
I don't watch that much T.V.
Just makin' my livin', baby
Well that's enough for me

You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, much too high,
Much too high, much too high
Much too high
